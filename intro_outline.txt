Introduction

  * Introduce topic and why it is important
    * use a hook, make it interesting (unresolved mystery, controversy, real-world issue needs attention)
  * What we know
    * respect the original aims of the research
    * be well-rounded in how you cite previous literature
  * What we don't know (but really need to figure out)
    * again, respect original aims of the research
  * How was this study designed to answer an important question we don't know
    * how does the study bring resolution or move us farther in the narrative
    * predictions
    * are there exploratory aspects of the study as well? distinguish what the study was intended to test and exploratory opportunities as well
      * also fine if the study is exploratory, just be clear on this!


Note differences across fields
  * Medical journals (including neuroscience) vs. psychological sciences
  * Examples:
      Really short: Erickson et al., 2010 PNAS
      A little longer: Erickson et al., 2009 JNeuro; Seeley et al., 2007 JNeuro
      Longer: Voss et al 2012, Clark et al., 2018
