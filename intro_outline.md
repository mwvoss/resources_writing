**Introduction**
* Think of the whole paper as an hour-glass where the width of the glass refers to the breadth or scope of detail in your writing. The introduction is the top of the hour-glass, moving from general to more specific. The methods and results will be the most 'narrow' aspect of the paper with respect to this metaphor.

  * First paragraph: Nice if you can encapsulate the basics of the narrative here
    * introduce topic and why it is important, try to use a hook to grab reader's attention 
    * introduce the basic narrative (unresolved mystery, controversy, real-world issue needs attention)
    * end with a brief statement of how the current study resolves the unknown
  * Provide more specifics as you work through the narrative. Need to address:
    * What we know
      * respect the original aims of the research
      * be well-rounded in how you cite previous literature
    * What we don't know (but really need to figure out)
      * again, respect original aims of the research
  * How was this study designed to answer an important question we don't know the answer to
    * how does the study bring resolution or move us farther in the narrative 
    * predictions
      * are there exploratory aspects of the study as well? distinguish what the study was intended to test and exploratory opportunities as well

Note differences across fields
  * Medical journals (including neuroscience) vs. psychological sciences
  * Examples:
      Really short: Erickson et al., 2010 PNAS
      A little longer: Erickson et al., 2009 JNeuro; Seeley et al., 2007 JNeuro
      Longer: Voss et al 2012, Clark et al., 2018
